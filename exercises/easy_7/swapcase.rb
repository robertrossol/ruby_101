# Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version. All other characters should be unchanged.

# You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

  words.chars.map do |char|
    char.upcase == char ? char.downcase : char.upcase

p swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
