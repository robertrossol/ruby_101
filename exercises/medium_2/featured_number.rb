# A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, and whose digits occur exactly once each. So, for example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

# Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number that is greater than the argument. Return an error message if there is no next featured number.

def featured(num)
  while num < 9_876_543_210
    num += 1
    return num if num.odd? && num % 7 == 0 && (num.to_s.chars == num.to_s.chars.uniq)
  end
  "Error: No next featured number"
end

#Solution handles the first two conditions first and then increments by 14 until the third condition is met (since += 14 will then always continue to meet the criteria)
# def featured(number)
#   number += 1
#   number += 1 until number.odd? && number % 7 == 0

#   loop do
#     number_chars = number.to_s.split('')
#     return number if number_chars.uniq == number_chars
#     number += 14
#     break if number >= 9_876_543_210
#   end
